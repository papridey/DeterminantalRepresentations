# DeterminantalRepresentations
This [Macaulay2](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/) package computes monic symmetric determinantal representations of hyperbolic plane curves. It is distributed with Macaulay2 since version 1.14, and backwards-compatible up to version 1.5. To manually install the latest version: 

- Download the [source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/papridey/DeterminantalRepresentations/master/DeterminantalRepresentations.m2) (right-click, save link as -> "DeterminantalRepresentations.m2")
- Open a Terminal window, and `cd` to the download location if necessary
- Start Macaulay2, and type `installPackage "DeterminantalRepresentations"`
- Once installed, one can load the package (from any location) with `needsPackage "DeterminantalRepresentations"`. Documentation can be viewed either in Terminal/Emacs with `help DeterminantalRepresentations`, or in a browser with `viewHelp DeterminantalRepresentations`

The accompanying article for this package is [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07035).
